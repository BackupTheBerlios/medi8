to-do list for medi8 feature

- we need to pick a license and update the feature.xml to reflect it
- medi8-tools and friends should be packaged as a plugin somehow
  or just an RPM?
  if we packaged them as plugins we could put them in the update site;
  but for this to work it would be best to package MLT this way as well
