TODO List
----------------

change how ConflictMarkerFigure works
it should not be an image but just hold other figures
then the layout engine could make it be something like
a red line with handles on either end, which stretches to
touch both of the tracks in conflict

get rid of gef scrollbar, use SWT one

mouse bindings
Simple edit commands: cut/copy/paste/move/delete

Markers
X Write new markers (maybe new types)
X Have Medi8layout know about them

Simple Commands
X Cut - send operation to sequence, store returned clip somewhere
X Copy - store returned clip
       [ this is implemented as Clip.clone() ]
X Paste - drop the stored clip at a given point
X Move - change starting point of some clip in sequence
* Insert - move everything over (maybe insert a split) to make room
   [ confusingly, this isn't InsertOrDeleteCommand, but something else
     that command is more like "add a clip" ]

Resolve a conflict by changing the conflict to a transition
effect.  A transition clip should be a handle, so that the
underlying transition can be changed easily

View window -> play the movie

Audio support
- show audio tracks linked to video tracks
- figure out how to handle editing tasks...

I/O:
X Pick a format (probably XML, we can share the representation we use for
  rendering - ?)
X Write readers and writers
- write export tool
X importing shouldn't require a copy to the workspace!
  (it won't, since we'll be able to use linked resources.)
  
Implement a Capture and Logging Perspective
- dvgrab is a useful tool, but keeping track of the resulting dv files
	is a PITA.  It would be nice to add a set of tools for capturing video
	(via dvgrab probably), and recording info in a database of some sort, like
	tape label, length, description, and maybe a couple of thumbnails.
